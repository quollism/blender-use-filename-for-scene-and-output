# blender-use-filename-for-scene-and-output

A quick Blender add-on which uses the filename for the scene's render output file and current scene name.

Usage:
- Install and enable it
- Every time you save a Blender file, the scene name and file output will change to the name of the file
- Disable it to stop it messing up your file

NB: The name change is made after the file is saved, so if it does something undesirable you can disable the add-on and Revert the file to get your render settings and scene name back.
